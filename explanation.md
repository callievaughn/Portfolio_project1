Option 1: Add two new components

LINK TO REPO


1.  A 'delete task' component that will allow the user to swipe and click the revealed delete button.
        Uses state 'tasks' that was already being used in original code that allowed user to add and check off tasks.
        Uses parameter 'key' to identify the task.
        Implements handleDeleteTask inside SwipeListView.

2. A 'change title' component that will allow the user to click on the title and then change and save the new title.
        Uses two new states 'editing' and 'newTitle' to implement handlers such as press, change, and save.
        Uses parameters 'title' and 'setTitle' to refer to a specific piece of data.
        Implemented setTitle inside TitleChanger.
